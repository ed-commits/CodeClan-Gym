| Constraint Category  | Implementation Constraint | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Hardware and Software Platforms | The server must run on my home computer. There is no dedicated powerful server available. This could mean my hardware may be slow when serving a large number of users. | I will test this software on the machine it will be running on|
| Performance Requirements | The User Interactions should be responsive and snappy, we don't want it to be slow and frustrating to use. | We will use the Sinatra webserver which is well engineered to give good performance |
| Persistent Storage and Transactions | All records need to be store and efficiently retreived and searched through | We will use an efficient database backend (PostgresQL) for managing and searching data |
| Usability | The site needs to be usable to everybody, whether they have an impairment or not | Start with UX thinking and apply our user stories during design |
| Budgets | There is no budget available for this project | Use free tools such as draw.io and wireframe.cc and coolers.co |
| Time Limitations | The deadline for the first prototype is 1 week | Plan efficiently, Keep the plan fluid and focus on the MVP |
