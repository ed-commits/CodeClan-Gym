| Constraint Category  | Implementation Constraint | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Hardware and Software Platforms | The server must run on my home computer. There is no dedicated powerful server available. This could mean my hardware may be slow when serving a large number of users. | I will test this software on the machine it will be running on|
| Performance Requirements | The User Interactions should be responsive and snappy, we don't want it to be slow and frustrating to use. We want the site to be responsive and quick. It's a problem because we want every page to load in a fraction of a second, so it doesn't feel sluggish | We will use the Sinatra webserver which is well engineered to give good performance |
| Persistent Storage and Transactions | All records need to be store and efficiently retreived and searched through. This will constrain the product as we will need to use an efficient system that has been implemented for this purpose. We can't just use a plain ruby array, it would be too slow even though it's simple. | We will use an efficient database backend (PostgresQL) for managing and searching data |
| Usability | The site needs to be usable to everybody, whether they have an impairment or not. This may require us to focus on form rather than function. This could be a problem if our designs are too fancy and artistic. | Start with UX thinking and apply our user stories during design |
| Budgets | There is no budget available for this project. We can't use any tools that need to be paid for. This is a problem because we will be limited in the tools available to us. | Use free tools such as draw.io and wireframe.cc and coolers.co |
| Time Limitations | The deadline for the first prototype is 1 week. This could constrain the features we can implement. This is a problem  because each feature takes time to implement. | Plan efficiently, Keep the plan fluid and focus on the MVP |
