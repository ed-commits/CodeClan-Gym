# Ideas for potential user stories

A new member will sign up by entering their name and date of birth,
the system will then take them to a page asking them about medical details.
They will be assigned a new PIN number.

A returning member will sign up with the same form but the system will find the existing record
and not ask them for all the medical details again.
They would get the same PIN number as when they previous used the gym.

Anyone trying to sign up who is under 16 would not be allowed access to the gym.

A pregnant person signing up will get an informational note about not taking part in HIIT type activities.
Plus information about how the attendants are pre and post natal qualified.

An existing member wants to search for classes on a given day and time slot.
After finding one they want to quickly book in just by clicking.
(possible extension: based on health condition, color code certain classes)

A staff account should be able to see the list of members attending a class.
